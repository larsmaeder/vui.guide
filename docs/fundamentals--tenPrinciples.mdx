While there are several established guidelines for GUIs, there are no equivalent principles for voice interfaces. This is critical as voice assistants are becoming increasingly popular and for some people are already an essential part of everyday life. Luckily the wheel does not have to be reinvented since [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/) has already created a thorough basis for GUIs â€“ namely [the usability heuristic for user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Keep in mind they are called "heuristics" because they are general rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. Based on these rules, the following ten principles are derived and adapted for best use in voice user interfaces.
