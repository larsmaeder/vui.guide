![Ten principles](/images/fundamentals/tenPrinciples.png)

While there are several established guidelines for GUIs, there are no equivalent principles for voice interfaces. This is critical as voice assistants are becoming increasingly popular and for some people are already an essential part of everyday life. Luckily the wheel does not have to be reinvented since [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/) has already created a thorough basis for GUIs – namely [the usability heuristic for user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Keep in mind they are called "heuristics" because they are general rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. Based on these rules, the following ten principles are derived and adapted for best use in voice user interfaces.

>
  As soon as a voice command is spoken, it is no longer visible unless there is
  a visual interface. To keep a smooth user flow, the user must always know when
  it is his turn to speak. For a good user experience it’s important to use
  feedback to tell the user what options are currently available for interacting
  with the voice user interface, whether visually or by voice. There is a high
  risk of the user becoming confused due to a lack of feedback, this risk
  increases if the voice user interface has not understood the spoken input or
  recognition errors have occurred.

  to="/docs/behaviour/behaviour-of-speak/"
>
  Short voice commands and keywords significantly improve the flow of user
  tasks. To achieve a compelling dialogue, it is better if a voice user
  interface not only understands short, firm commands, but also more natural
  commands. Speak the user’s language using what is already known and without
  system-relevant keywords. Using simple language is the most attractive and
  accessible way to people with different backgrounds. It is recommended to
  learn from interpersonal communication to make these interactions as natural
  and intuitive as possible.

  title="User control and freedom"
  to="/docs/behaviour/freedom-of-user-control/"
>
  Users often feel rushed to interact with a voice interface and worry about
  missing parts of the interaction. This leads to a common problem of
  frustration due to the lack of control over the voice interface. It is
  important that the user has control of every interaction at all times, but is
  also free to pass control of the interaction to the system.

  title="Prevent and recover from errors"
  to="/docs/behaviour/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/"
>
  Avoid user errors when users interact with the voice interface. When designing
  speech interfaces, there are two types of elements that can be accessed:
  auditory and visual elements. Auditory elements are fundamental and required
  for every voice user interface. Use visual elements to significantly improve
  the conversation between the user and the voice interface. This avoids user
  errors and increases confidence in the user interface.

  title="Recognition rather than recall"
  to="/docs/behaviour/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/"
>
  Users should always be able to remember voice commands – but they shouldn’t do
  that on his own. It is important that voice interfaces supports users in how
  they use the voice interface, for example how they interact with it and in
  showing which commands lead to which actions. Also, audio as the only output
  should not be preferred because it increases cognitive stress and the user has
  to remember long information.

  title="Task efficiency"
  to="/docs/behaviour/handling-user-intents/"
>
  Flexibility is useful for productivity and user satisfaction with the voice
  interface. Due to the lack of keyboard shortcuts in voice interfaces,
  designers have to rethink how they can improve task efficiency for users.
  Think about how a user can perform an action in several ways instead of
  following a prescribed path.

  title="Minimalism in design and dialogue"
  to="/docs/behaviour/wording/"
>
  Large information typically affects the user’s ability to remember what has
  been said earlier through the voice interface. Do not give the user all the
  information at once. Provide only the most relevant information. Remember that
  minimalism is all about letting the unnecessary go.

  title="Allow users to recognize and recover from errors"
  to="/docs/behaviour/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/"
>
  Let the user recognize errors and provide a fallback option. Allow the user to
  avoid errors by understanding how they occurred and how the user’s intentions
  must be properly performed so that the errors do not repeat. In the event of
  errors and missing information, make sure that you specify exactly what
  information is understood and which information is missing – try to ask the
  user only for the missing pieces instead of a standard saying like: “Sorry, I
  didn’t get that.”.

  title="Providing help and documentation"
  to="/docs/behaviour/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/"
>
  If the user no longer knows how to proceed, always give help. At best, provide
  contextual help within the interaction. Users shouldn’t have to leave the
  current conversation to get help. Instead, help should be a built-in function
  available in the active conversation. This always provides quick access and
  support to the user, but still only when needed.

  title="Considering how context affects speech interaction"
  to="/docs/fundamentals/is-conversation-the-right-fit/"
>
  Users often feel uncomfortable speaking on their phones in front of other
  people, as this is not a common form of a natural interaction. To ensure the
  best voice interaction, think about when and how the user will use the voice
  interface. Or whether it is best to avoid a voice interface utterly in some
  cases.
