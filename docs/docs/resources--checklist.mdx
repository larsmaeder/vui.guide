Creating a voice user interface is complex and difficult, because otherwise the vui.guide would somehow be redundant â€“ I hope not. As we learned from the <Link to="/docs/behaviour/behaviour-of-speak#do-what-humans-already-do/">behavior of speak</Link> part, it is also difficult to remember every detail. This can also be applied to understanding this guide.

This section is intended to help you to keep track of everything important while creating a voice user interface by listing the most important points in a checklist for you.

## What type are you designing?

Select a suitable checklist depending on the type of voice user interface you are designing:

<Card
  title="Voice only"
  to="/docs/resources/checklist/voice-only"
  cta="Start"
>
  I am designing a voice user interface <strong>without</strong> built-in display or any other
  screen dependency.
</Card>
<Card title="Voice user interface" to="/docs/resources/checklist/vui" cta="Start">
  I am designing a voice user interface  <strong>with</strong> a built-in display or any other
  screen dependency.
</Card>
