The emerge of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) is a big change in human-computer interaction. Controlling devices via touch subside or disappears entirely because voice interfaces are mainly operated via voice. The design of voice user interfaces has changed fundamentally from designing apps for graphical user interfaces (GUI).

This leads to new questions and an upcoming challenge for UI-/UX-Designers: “How do designers design voice interfaces for optimal user guidance?”, “What visual elements are available to me as a designer to support acoustic elements?” or “How does the user’s environment influence my design and user guidance?” and so on.

## How to use this guide

vui.guide is divided into two areas, a design and a contribute part. As a designer use the design part to create voice user interface and use the contribute part to make a contribution to improve the guide.

### As a designer
