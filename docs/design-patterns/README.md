Most designers are familiar with the use of design patterns in their workflow. But the overall design process for VUI is different, as it's mostly non-visual. If we focus on the visual part of VUIs, we will find that well-known user interface design patterns, such as those for web or app user interfaces, are very similar to those for voice user interfaces. The following design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems in voice user interfaces. This section helps you recognize when to use them and how to customize them.

## Types of design patterns

| Design Pattern                                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Card](/docs/design-patterns/card/)                      | Use a card to visually group parts of text or images that require action, for example, to access more details.                  |
| [Carousel](/docs/design-patterns/carousel/)              | A carousel can display a large number of elements. Use carousels so that the user only concentrates on a few elements at a time. |
| [List](/docs/design-patterns/list/)                      | Guides the user to content that is relevant and interesting for them.                                                            |
| [Chip](/docs/design-patterns/chip/)                      | Use a chip to predefine snippets that allow users to refine topics, discover related topics, or take the next steps and actions. |
| [Table](/docs/design-patterns/table/)                    | A table is used to present non-interactive tabular data.                                                                        |
| [Audio card](/docs/design-patterns/audio-card/)          | An audio card is used to play and control audio content such as music, news, or podcasts.                                      |
