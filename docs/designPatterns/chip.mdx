Chips are used to provide a quick way to respond in a conversation without voice interaction but within the vui environment.

## Why using a chip?

Chips are a quick way and alternative to take action without using voice. Users can refine topics, discover related topics, take the next steps, or take action. In some cases, using chips can be easier and faster than using voice interaction or entering the answer. If the user selects a chip, it integrates as part of the conversation as the user's response.

## Guidance

When the voice interface returns a question to the user, a chip can be provided during a conversation to provide predefined and simplified answer options to the user.

### Interactivity

- **Tap:** integrates the text as part of the conversation as the user's response.
- **Scroll:** scrolls horizontally through the chip arrangement

### Structure of a chip

Chips are basically just text and have no complex structure. However, they must stand out visually from normal text. The best way to do this is to have a contour or a button-like look.
