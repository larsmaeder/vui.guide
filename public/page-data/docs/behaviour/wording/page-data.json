Give the user time to think and don't try to give out all the details from the start. Unless the user requests it and benefits from it.\n\n### Avoid jargon\n\nAvoid jargon, especially in error messages and system topics such as settings, they are misleading and difficult to understand. The VUI is here to help and not to generate further questions.\n\n### Use short, simple words\n\nSimple language is easy to understand making it accessible to people of all backgrounds.\n\n### Make it feel natural\n\nEven if it's the same question, it's strange to answer the same thing every time. Provide a variety of answers, just like a person would do in a normal conversation. This makes the conversation feel more natural.\n\n### Lead the user\n\nGive the user a reason to do something. Follow this formula: “To get what you want, do this thing.”\n\n### Don't provide any UI-specific instructions\n\nRather refer to actions than UI-specific instructions. In this way, the VUI can continue to be used even if no user interface is available and to intercept possible upcoming design changes.\n\n### Use contractions\n\nUse contractions instead of spelling out words. Contractions sound less punitive and more natural and conversational.\n\n### Commas\n\nUse serial comma to add clarity in a list of 3 or more items.\n\n### Exclamation points\n\nAvoid harsh or commanding language.\n\n### Sentence case\n\nUse sentence case and capitalize only the first word of titles, headings, labels, etc. This is easier to scan than title case.\n\n### Numerals\n\nUse numerals instead of writing out numbers. Numerals are easier to read and make visual content more clear.\n\n### Time\n\nUse the format \"AM\" or \"PM\".\n\n### Capital letters\n\nAvoid capital letters as they can be perceived as shouting.\n","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#dos-and-donts","title":"Dos and dont's"}]},"fields":{"timeToRead":{"minutes":1.795,"text":"2 min read","time":107700,"words":359}},"frontmatter":{"category":"behaviour","title":"Wording","navDocTitle":"Wording","toc":true}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7e55fb7d-2140-5ec3-aa9c-adcbdf02e38c","frontmatter":{"title":"Wording","navDocTitle":"Wording","slug":"/docs/behaviour/wording/","category":"behaviour","sort":3,"toc":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
