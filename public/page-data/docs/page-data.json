Controlling devices via touch subside or disappears entirely because voice interfaces are mainly operated via voice. The design of voice user interfaces has changed fundamentally from designing apps for graphical user interfaces (GUI).\n\nThis leads to new questions and an upcoming challenge for UI-/UX-Designers: “How do designers design voice interfaces for optimal user guidance?”, “What visual elements are available to me as a designer to support acoustic elements?” or “How does the user’s environment influence my design and user guidance?” and so on.\n\n## How to use this guide\n\nvui.guide is divided into two areas, a design and a contribute part. As a designer use the design part to create voice user interface and use the contribute part to make a contribution to improve the guide.\n\n### As a designer\n\nNavigate through the guide with the menu bar on the left. There is a resource area with useful tools and a <Link to=\"/docs/resources/checklist/\">checklist</Link> that gives you an overview of the most important points and helps you step by step in creating a design for a voice user interface.\n\n### As a contributor\n\nvui.guide is open source and licensed under a [MIT](https://github.com/larsmaeder/vui.guide#-license) and [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://github.com/larsmaeder/vui.guide#-license). Add new or edit existing articles, share your knowledge with others and edit existing articles to become a part of the voice user interface guide. \n\n## Start contribution\n\nVisit the <Link to=\"/contribute/\">contribute</Link> section for instructions on how to start contributing to the voice user interface guide.\n","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#how-to-use-this-guide","title":"How to use this guide"},{"url":"#start-contribution","title":"Start contribution"}]},"frontmatter":{"category":null,"title":"Docs","navDocTitle":"Introduction","toc":false}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3ea6ef3b-5e70-5595-9fbf-1636d98d7ae8","frontmatter":{"title":"Docs","navDocTitle":"Introduction","slug":"/docs/","toc":false}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
