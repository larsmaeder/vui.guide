Each individual item can be clicked to open further information in an external service, i.e. a web browser.\n\n## Why using a carousel?\n\nA carousel can be very useful to display a large number of items without distracting the user from the item currently being displayed.\nThe user can swipe through the carousel to reveal new items. It teases the user with a few examples to let them know that there is more to reveal.\n\n## Guidance\n\nA carousel item can contains different elements but all articles must be consistent with each other, i.e. if one element has a picture, the other elements must also have a picture. It is important to keep textual elements short and informativ, detailed information is only displayed in a further step after the user taps on the carousel element.\n\n### Interactivity\n\n- **Tap:** opens further information in an external service, i.e. web browser.\n- **Swipe:** slide items to reveal items.\n\n### Structure of a carousel\n\nThe structure of a carousel item is similiar to a <Link to=\"/docs/design-patterns/card/#structure-of-a-card\">card</Link>, but since the element itself triggers an action, a visible action link like \"Read more\" is not required. A carousel can contain an image, a short title and a short text.\n\n![Structure of a carousel.](/images/designPatterns/carouselStructure.png)\n\n| Components  |\n| ----------- |\n| **1** Image |\n| **2** Title |\n| **3** Text  |\n\n","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#why-using-a-carousel","title":"Why using a carousel?"},{"url":"#guidance","title":"Guidance"}]},"fields":{"timeToRead":{"minutes":1.19,"text":"2 min read","time":71400,"words":238}},"frontmatter":{"category":"designPatterns","title":"Carousel","navDocTitle":"Carousel","toc":true}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2682135f-36b6-5016-aa70-11b90ace799e","frontmatter":{"title":"Carousel","navDocTitle":"Carousel","slug":"/docs/design-patterns/carousel/","category":"designPatterns","sort":3,"toc":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
