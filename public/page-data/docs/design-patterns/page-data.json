But the overall design process for VUI is different, as it's mostly non visual. If we focus on the visual part of VUIs, we will find that well-known user interfaces design patterns such as for web or app user interfaces are very similar to those for voice user interfaces. The following design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems in voice user interfaces. This section helps you to recognize, when to use and how to customize them.\n\n## Types of design patterns\n\n| Design&nbsp;Pattern                                            | Description                                                                                                                      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| <Link to=\"/docs/design-patterns/card/\">Card</Link>             | Use a card to visually group parts of text or images that require action.
