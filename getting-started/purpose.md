The emergence of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) represents a significant shift in human-computer interaction. Controlling devices via touch is subsiding or disappearing entirely, as voice interfaces are primarily operated through speech. The design of voice user interfaces has fundamentally changed compared to designing apps for graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

This raises new questions and challenges for UI/UX designers:  
- **How do designers create voice interfaces for optimal user guidance?**  
- **What visual elements are available to support acoustic elements?**  
- **How does the userâ€™s environment influence design and user guidance?**  
- ...and many more.

## How to use this guide
