## User Experience

### Have you considered how the user uses the VUI?
Find out how users interact with the voice interface to optimize the user interaction for their purpose.  
- [Is conversation the right fit](/docs/principles/is-conversation-the-right-fit/)  
- [Handling user intents](/docs/behavior/handling-user-intents/)  

### If the VUI is location-dependent, did you include this in your design process?
Consider that many users feel uncomfortable speaking loudly to a device in front of other people, in public places, or even in their own private rooms.  
- [Is conversation the right fit](/docs/principles/is-conversation-the-right-fit/)  

### Does the use of your voice interface help the user?
Help users by providing assistance at all times throughout the interaction.  
- [Prevent and recover from errors](/docs/behavior/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/#help-and-documentation)  

### Can the user always control the VUI?
The user has control of each interaction at all times but can also transfer control of the interaction to the system.  
- [Freedom of user control](/docs/behavior/freedom-of-user-control/)

## Communication

### Does your VUI provide conversation status feedback using voice?
Communicate currently available options or errors while interacting with the voice interface.  
- [Feedback of conversation status](/docs/behavior/feedback-of-conversation-status/)  

### Does your VUI speak simple language?
Use everyday language and avoid technical jargon, as this only confuses the user.  
- [behavior of speak](/docs/behavior/behavior-of-speak/#do-what-humans-already-do)  
- [Wording](/docs/behavior/wording/)  

### Does the VUI help the user remember conversations?
Users should always be able to recall voice commands. Wherever possible, show the user which interaction leads to which result.  
- [Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors](/docs/behavior/prevent-and-recover-from-errors/)  

### Does the VUI minimize the amount of information in dialogue?
Minimize the amount of information communicated to the user.
