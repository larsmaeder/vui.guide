Creating a voice user interface is complex and difficultâ€”otherwise, *vui.guide* would be redundant (I hope not!). As we learned from the [behavior of speak](/docs/behavior/behavior-of-speak#do-what-humans-already-do/) section, it is also difficult to remember every detail. This applies to understanding this guide as well.

This section is intended to help you keep track of everything important while creating a voice user interface by listing the most crucial points in a checklist.

## What type are you designing?

Select a suitable checklist depending on the type of voice user interface you are designing:

### [Voice only](/docs/resources/checklist/voice-only)  

I am designing a voice user interface **without** a built-in display or any other screen dependency.  

### [Voice user interface](/docs/resources/checklist/vui)  

I am designing a voice user interface **with** a built-in display or any other screen dependency.
